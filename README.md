<h1>Study Project: Exploring JavaScript Concepts</h1>
Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to JavaScript! Here, you'll find a project centered around learning and understanding the core concepts of JavaScript.
</br><br>
<b>What is JavaScript?</b><br>
JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily used for front-end web development. It adds interactivity, behavior, and dynamic features to web pages. With JavaScript, you can manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), handle user interactions, and create dynamic content that responds to user actions without requiring a page reload.

Through this project, I am focusing on learning various aspects of the language, including variables, functions, conditionals, loops, and more. By exploring practical examples and exercises, I aim to solidify my understanding of JavaScript's capabilities and syntax.
